CSharpSDK
=========

SDK for C#/.net environments other than Unity

Installing:

1. Add all the .cs files under PlayFabClientSDK/source to your project.
2. Add a reference to Newtonsoft.Json to your project. In VS, this can be done through NuGet Manager by searching for Json.NET. In Xamarin Studio, you can search for Json.NET in the Component Store.
